zillow_scraper
==============
Final project for the online computer science class (Harvard's CS50x) in April 2014.

The general infrastructure (page rendering and MySQL integration) is not mine, it was adopted from one of the CS50x projects. The core scraping, parsing and processing functionality (my bread and butter) is in "client_1/brokers".

The live app is at http://www.non-descript.net/, password "hbs".
Code for the second part of the app (Intuitive Surgical scraping) is not posted on GitHub because it's just a much simpler version of Zillow's - single source page, no MySQL processing and no retention stats.
